# IMPORTANT

I finished the API challenge and just to explain how it works, you basically 
node the index.js file and you can either go to postman or
your webbrowser and go to localhost:4200

you can choose either of these 3 routes,
    /activity
    /param/{activity} ex /param/diy
    /Oneactivity
NOTE: The /Oneactivity only shows the activity: "" data.
