    <img src="arch.png" id=left4>
    <img src="artix.png" id=right4>
    <p> This community matters to me because I use Arch-Linux and being Linux and Open-Source, It's up to the community to make some software and apply fixes and patches.
      To be apart of this community means that I use Arch Linux and contribute to it. I don't use mainline Arch but I use Artix a fork of Arch. Arch Linux's community is so great that 
      it gave them the AUR, the Arch User Repository.
