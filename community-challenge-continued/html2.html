<div id=container>
    <div class="ma" id=Setup2>  <h3 id="style"> Mexican Community </h3> <img src="flag.jpg" id="right"/> <p> This community matters to me because I am apart of a lot of people who are 'different' and have a different background and that I know that I am not alone. To me, being apart of this community means that I am with a group of people who are like me and that can understand and support me. </p> </div>     
    <div class=second > <h3 id=style> Free software Community</h3> <p id=p3> Now when I say free, I mean free as in freedom. Now that might sound good but it is hard to be 100% free out of proprietery software. For example, some of the drivers your computer and hardware needs are probably proprietary. However I am not and probably won't be 100% free I do support what the FS community is doing. </p>  <img src="gnu-logo.png" id=lef9> </div>

<div id=Setup2>
  <div class="cycle"> 
    <h3 id="style"> Cycling Community</h3>
    <img src="bicycle.jpeg" id="left"/>
    <p> This community matters to me because cycling has calmed me down, and helped so many times. I love cycling because of the cool breeze and how relaxing it feels.
      Being apart of this community means that you love cycling whether you do it as exercise or casually, cycling is a great sport and can you help you destress or relax for a bit.

  <div class=second1 > <h3 id=style> LGBTQ+ Community</h3> <p id=p3> I am not part of the LGBTQ+ community but I think that they shouldn't be mistreated or even executed just because they came out liking their same gender or liking or being neither. I think that everyone should just have a choice and stick with it and not be punished for it. </p>  <img src="flag2.png" id=lef9> </div>


<div id=Setup>

  <div class="android"> 

    <h3 id="style"> Android Community </h3>

    <img src="android.png" id="left2"/>
    <img src="phone.jpg" id="right2"/>
    <p id="p2"> This community matters to me because I own an android and I might have some problems with it, but the community is there to help me.
      Being apart of this to me means that I have an android phone and that I am okay with it as it works just like any other phone, android also comes in many different falvors.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class=second2 > <h3 id=style> BSD Community</h3> <p id=p3> BSD is another operating system like GNU/LINUX. It is open-soruce but works a whole lot different than the Linux Kernel and GNU system. The most popular of these BSD distros is Freebsd and I have used it for a little while, I didn't get to familiar with it and switched back to linux. But I will support this community and the project, I think it is a great OS that does somethings better than Linux. </p>  <img src="Freebsd.png" id=lef9> </div>

  <div class="Ricers">

    <h3 id=Style> Ricers Community</h3>
    <img src="rice.png" id=left3>
    <img src="riced.png" id=right3>

    <p id=psmall> You might be thinking, what is the Ricers communtiy? Is it a bunch of people who eat rice or something, No. This community matters to me because I think it made me more productive 
      and more in control. if you haven't heard the term rice as in ricing something than I don't blame you. It's term used in the linux (window manager community) and the community is essentially people
      who configure their window manager to how they want it to be. To be apart of this Community means that I can seek help or ask for a configuration or tool and someone out there can help me, also people can make some crazy code or configurations and make it public!

  <div class="WM">
    <h3 id=Style> Window Manager Community</h3>
    <img src="bspwm.jpg" id=left4>
    <img src="dwm.png" id=right4>
    <p> As I said I use window managers, and this community matters to me becuase they bring unique ways on how to use, troubleshoot, and write code for window managers. My two favorite
      window managers are dwm and bspwm, though awesomewm is getting there. 
      Being apart of this community means that I can learn different coding languages and can start patching my window manager.
     </p>
  </div>
  <div class=second3 > <h3 id=style> Blind Community</h3> <p id=p3> Though I'll consider myself somewhat blind, at least I'm not fully blind. However I do feel sympathy to people who are blind, if not being able to see very clearly is bad than seeing little to nothing would be even worse and I'm thankful that I'm not fully blind. </p>  <img src="blindman.png" id=lef9> </div>

<div id=Setup> 
  <div class="Tech"> 
    <h3 id=Style> Technology Community</h3>
      <img src="pios.jpg" id=left5> 
      <img src="linuxsupercom.jpg" id=right5>
      <p> I would say that I am apart of the technology community. I am really interested in technology and in the future
        I want to be a server admin or a sys admin, a whitehat hacker, a computer engineer, or computer scientist. One thing I am saving up money for is the rasberry pi.
        Being apart of this community means that I know my way around a computer and the community here can get super specific and "nerdy" but that's the way I like it.

  <div class=Code>
    <h3 id=Style> Coding Community. </h3>
    <p> This community matters to me because, As I said I am really interested in Techonology and Computers. I want to try and learn to code so that I can help the world with machines or software.
    To be apart of this community means that there is tons and tons of documentation of different languages like python, C, and javascript. What's even better is that thanks to get and things like
    github and gitlab people are out there that can help polish, fix, or wrerite your code.

    <h3 id=Style> Glassess Community </h3>
    <img src="glasses.png" id=right6>
    <img src="linustorvalds.jpg" id=left6>
    <p> This community matters to me because I started wearing glassess since 1st or 2nd grade, I used to be embarrassed about wearing glassess but some people in my class were wearing glassess and I became friends with them.
      Now I'm not embarrassed to say that I wear glassess and I think they're pretty cool because they make you look smarter or someone with a high position.

    <p > This community matters to me because I believe in people's freedom  and the right to fork and redistribute.
      Being apart of this community to me means that I mainly use Free and Open-Source software and programs. I would also 
      contribute to Open-Source projects and follow the Open-Source code and make this code Open-Source.
    </p>

  <div class=second4 > <h3 id=style> Linux Community</h3> <p id=p3> Hey don't you use linux? yes arch btw, but can you really have a community if everyone is kinda against each other? Like the Arch people really don't like ubuntu but the Ubuntu people don't like Arch and think it's a hipster distro. Then there's gentoo. I like to think of the community as something like the U.S or other multi-state countries. We may be different but share the same home. That's why I fully support the development of linux and the people behind the database. </p>  <img src="tux.png" id=lef9> </div>

  <div class=Arch> 

    <h3 id=style> Arch-Linux Community </h3>
    <img src="arch.png" id=left7>
    <img src="artix.png" id=right7>
    <p> This community matters to me because I use Arch-Linux and being Linux and Open-Source, It's up to the community to make some software and apply fixes and patches.
      To be apart of this community means that I use Arch Linux and contribute to it. I don't use mainline Arch but I use Artix a fork of Arch. Arch Linux's community is so great that 
      it gave them the AUR, the Arch User Repository.
